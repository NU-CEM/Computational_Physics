    "\n",
    "PDEs can also be separated in a similar manner. <mark>Boundary value problems</mark> describe the behaviour of a variable in a space and we are given some constraints on the variable around the boundary of that space. For example, consider the 2-dimensional problem of a thin rectangular sheet with one side at voltage $V$ and all others at voltage zero.\n",

It differs from a boundary condition in that we are told what the temperature is at the start of our time grid (at $t=0$) but not at the end of our time grid (when the simulation finishes).\n",
