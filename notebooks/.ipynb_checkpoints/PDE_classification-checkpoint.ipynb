    "### Partial differential equations have multiple inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section of the course we studied <bold>ordinary differential equations</bold>. ODEs have a single input (also known as independent variable) - for example, time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Partial differential equations (PDEs) have multiple inputs (independent variables). For example, think about a sheet of metal that has been heated unevenly across the surface. Over time, heat will diffuse through the 2-dimensional sheet. The temperature depends on both time *and* position - there are two inputs.\n",

    "Because PDEs have multiple inputs they are generally much more difficult to solve analytically than ODEs. However, there are a range of numerical methods that can be used to find approximate solutions."
