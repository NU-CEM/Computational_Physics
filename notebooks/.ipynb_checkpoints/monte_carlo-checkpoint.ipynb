    "### There are many different numerical methods for calculating integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we studied the simplest methods for calculating integrals: the rectangular-slice method . For increased accuracy and computational efficiency, there are extensions to this approach - for example, the trapezoid method (where each slice is a trapezoid rather than rectangle) or Simpson's rule (where a quadratic curve is fitted to each slice). For certain classes of functions we can increase the performance further using more specialised approaches such as Gaussian Quadrature.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particularly flexible and general purpose approach for calculating integrals is to use Monte Carlo integration. This approach is useful when the integrand is \"pathological\" (wildly varying) or noisy, or when the integration is performed over several variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo methods calculate the answers to exact calculations by doing random calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of algorithms that rely on random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. \"Monte Carlo\" is a reference to a well-known casino town, since the element of chance is core to the modelling approach, similar to various casino games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods are applied across a wide variety of domains, most commonly mathematics, physics and finance. In physics, Monte Carlo methods are used to design particle detectors, model galaxy evolution and solve the many-body problem for quantum systems, amongst many other applications. In this lesson we will introduce one of the main uses of Monte Carlo: for integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Monte Carlo \"area method\" estimates integrals by generating a uniform sample of points and counting how many fall into a planar region\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the shaded area as shown below. This is the integral $I$ which we wish to calculate.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we choose a point uniformly at random in the rectange (dashed red line) that bounds the shaded area, the probability $p$ that the point falls in the shaded area is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{I}{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is the area of the bounding rectangle. This means that the integral $I$ can be calculated if we know the area of the bounding rectangle and the probability $p$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = Ap$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate $p$ we can randomly generate $N$ points in the bounding area and keep count as to how many lie in the shaded area. If $k$ lie in the shaded area then the fraction of points $\\frac{k}{N}$ should be equal to the probability $p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = \\frac{Ak}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend this approach to higher dimensions to consider integrands lying within a bounding volume, or higher dimensional space (which is considered in the [extension exercise](https://nu-cem.github.io/CompPhys/2021/08/02/Random_extension) for this lesson).\n",
    "\n",
    "### We can use the Monte Carlo area method to estimate pi\n",

    "The relevant equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "square area: $A_s = (2 r)^2$  \n",
    "circle area: $A_c = \\pi r^2$  \n",

    "$$\\frac{A_c}{A_s} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4 r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$  \n",
    "$$\\pi = 4\\frac{A_c}{A_s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To approximate the ratio $\\frac{A_c}{A_s}$ we will generate a (uniform) pseudo-random number between 0 and 1 for our x-coordinates, and a (uniform) pseudo-random number between 0 and 1 for our y-coordinates. We will then check if our random point lies in or out of the circle. The probability $P_i$ that our point lies in the circle is related to the area ratio and so value of pi:\n",

However Monte Carlo methods are more flexible and can be used where other methods break-down: for example, they are particularly useful for integrating functions where the integrand varies very quickly, and/or where the integral is over many variables. In many cases, for \"well behaved\" functions, an approach based on Riemann summation will give more accurate and computationally efficient results."
