This website contains resources for the second year course "Theory, computation and experiment" (KD5081) at Northumbria University, UK. The resources have been developed by [Dr Lucy Whalley](https://lucydot.github.io). 

The website is powered by a [Github repository](https://github.com/NU-CEM/Computational_Physics/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). Text is formatted with Markdown and equations are formatted with LaTeX.
